#### About the project
Shortly after joining the Analytics Cloud team at [Liferay](https://www.liferay.com), I had the chance to work on the new A/B testing feature for the platform. The team kicked-off the project with a design sprint, and after that I was the sole designer working on the Analytics Cloud side of the project. 

My responsibilities for this project included:
- Establishing a cross-product user flow and getting approval from multiple stakeholders
- Collaborating with a designer from Liferay DXP to ensure cross-product consistency
- Working within and expanding upon our design system to build the A/B testing UI on Analytics Cloud
- Working internationally with our development team in Brazil

The resulting feature was deeply integrated into with Liferay's Digital Experience Platform (DXP). Leveraging the site building capabilities in DXP, users can quickly make a new A/B test on a page, set a metric to measure, select an element to track click events on if necessary, select a target audience, and run the test. Liferay's Analytics Cloud then does the heavy lifting tracing and reporting the data for the test and eventually gives the user a test result, with the handy option to publish the winning variant directly from the report.
