#### How Subdivide Began
Subdivide is a side project that developed out of seeing a clear need for a better metronome that had features specifically for the marching arts. With the industry standard being a clunky hadware metronome that costs $200, me and my developer friend saw an opportunity to upgrade the experience of using a metronome during practice through an app. Subdivide has gone through a few iterations now, and is currently in the process of being designed and developed for iOS too.
<br /><br /><br /> 

#### The Features
Since the idea of having a metronome as an app isn't a new one, there were already a handful of features that were required for an MVP. These included the ability to quickly set a tempo, change the time signature (what we call Beats per Bar), set accent patterns, and set subdvisions for the beats. In Subdivide, these all reside in the main metronome screen, along with the ability to save configurations as presets for easy access. Beats per bar, accent patterns, subdivisions, and presets are all located in a bar at the bottom of the screen for easy thumb access because these are the options most likely to be changed on-the-fly while the metronome is running. Changing tempo on-the-fly is possible through the buttons by the tempo indicator, but our main differentiating feature, Tracks, solves the most common use case of that need.

The Tracks feature allows users to string together a series of sections with different tempos, subdivisions, and accent patterns. For smooth tempo changes, a transition section can be added that accelerandos or deccelerandos between two different tempos over a set number of beats.
