### The Problem

**99.8% of users bounced** when arriving at the first page of GrandPad's buy flow, whether coming from a point in the sales funnel or landing directly on the page. Mobile devices were starting to account for a large percentage of our visitors, and none of the buy flow was optimized well for mobile.

### The Goal of the Redesign

The main goal was to improve the bounce rate on the first page and retain users through the flow. After evaluating the current iteration of the checkout flow and doing some research, I decided to focus on these points to achieve that goal:

- Minimize the amount of data collection needed, which would cut back on the number of steps a user would have to take.

### Constraints:

- Time (marketing campaign)
- Resources (Me + 1 developer)
- Couldn't rely on 3rd party checkouts (PayPal, Amazon, etc)
- In order to deliver a GrandPad, we had to collect info on multiple people.

### Research

To help with research, we enlisted the help of a marketing firm we had just begun to work with.
