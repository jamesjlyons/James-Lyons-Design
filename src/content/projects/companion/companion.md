#### The Problem

As a compliment to the tablet for seniors, GrandPad provided mobile apps for family members to communicate and share photos with the tablet user. Essentially, they were social media apps meant to privately communicate with family. The iOS and Android companion apps were both functional, but were in dire need of a a more cohesive user experience between both platforms. And they honestly needed a fresh coat of paint to match with the newer website and [`checkout process`](/project/grandpad-checkout) UI. The Android app had also fallen behind in terms of features, so it was time to being it up to speed.
<br /><br /><br />

#### The Goal of the Redesign

The iOS redesign came first, so it was going to set the direction for the Android redesign. These were my priorities for both apps:

1. **Leverage OS design guidelines to create cohesive experiences.** The current apps didn't follow the HIG or Material Design specs, but also weren't consistent with themselves. There wasn't enough time alloted to build out a single design system to translate across both iOS and Android, and staying closer to the HIG and Material specs would help users feel more comfortable using the app on the respective platforms.
2. **Organize the photo comments better.** Comments on photos came in either text or audio format from the GrandPad tablet, and the UI needed a clearer differentiation for voice comments.
3.  **Add a notification center.** There was no place to see past notifications within the app, so it was a priority to add a place where users could see all new and past notifications.

#### The iOS App
Full disclaimer: The design of the bottom tabs with an action button over it ended up getting axed towards the end of development. The shipped version has a standard bottom navigation and a "New Post" button in the top toolbar.
