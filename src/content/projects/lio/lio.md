#### Why we built Lio
The awesome team over at [`Blockstack`](https://blockstack.net) was having their first contest to build apps for their decentralized platform, and the requirement was to build a cryptocurrency portfolio app than ran on Blockstack technology. Lio was built as a challenge for me and Alec, my development partner at [`Tap Five`](https://tapfive.io), to see what we could build in a short amount of time and possibly place well in the contest. We decided to focus on a market that we knew well, users who wanted dead-simple portfolio tracking.

#### The Landing Page

#### The Portfolio Overview

#### The Breakdowns

#### Results
Did we win the contest? No. But it was a lot of fun to build, and the team who reviwewed or app at Blockstack ranked the design and code highly.
Lio is also what ultimately gave us the idea to have a business name to work under since we would have two projects now (the other being [`Subdivide`](/project/subdivide).
