      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I am a Product Designer at Liferay in Southern California. I'm currently designing on the Analytics Cloud product team, and made a handy Figma plugin to help our process.
        <br /> <br />
      I also currently design and code stuff like Subdivide and Lio with Tap Five, a team of two who likes to make things that don't suck.
        <br /> <br />
      I previously worked as the Lead Designer at GrandPad. I was the first designer the startup had hired in it's three years of existence, and I did much of the front-end development for the main website and checkout. During my time there, I established a UX design process within the company by encouraging user research, idea validation, and interactive prototype testing. I helped raise the quality of product designs by establishing cohesive visual patterns across websites and mobile apps. I led the process of two different website redesigns, launched iOS and Android app redesigns, set up A/B tests, designed and coded emails, and did some minor branding work.</p>
